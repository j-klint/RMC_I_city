# 8.0 CITY DESIGN

Back some decades ago we used to play a lot of Rolemaster and I also used to
dick around in [*QBasic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) up until
Windows 98 or however long it lasted. Even after it was officially
discontinued, I would keep copying the `qbasic.exe` to my of newer windowses
for as long as it would remain functional.

The first Rolemaster Companion (ICE #1500) had formulae for randomly
generating (*"procedural generation"!* gasp!) the numbers for the amounts of
practicioners of the various adventuring professions. The introductory
paragraphes stated:

> This process is suitable for a program on a personal computer. GM's are
> invited to teach their favorite machines how to build ***Rolemaster***
> cities.

Back some 20 years ago I indeed did teach my 'puter to do it in *QBasic*, but
now that I've finally been learning some (hopefully?) more modern programming
languages, here's my updated response to the invitation, in Python3.
